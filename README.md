# :bar_chart: What is Evidently?

Evidently is an open-source Python library for data scientists and ML engineers. It helps evaluate, test, and monitor ML models from validation to production. It works with tabular, text data and embeddings. 

Evidently has a modular approach with 3 components on top of the shared `metrics` functionality. 

## 1. Tests: batch model checks

![Tests example](docs/images/evidently_tests_main-min.png)

Tests perform structured data and ML model checks. They verify a condition and return an explicit **pass** or **fail**. 

You can create a custom Test Suite from 50+ tests or run a preset (for example, **Data Drift** or **Regression Performance**). You can get results as a **JSON**, Python dictionary, exportable HTML, **visual report** inside Jupyter notebook, or as Evidently JSON `snapshot`. 

Tests are best for automated checks. You can integrate them as a pipeline step using tools like Airlfow. 

## 2. Reports: interactive visualizations

> Old dashboards API was deprecated in v0.1.59. Here is the [migration guide](docs/book/support/migration.md).

![Report example](docs/images/evidently_reports_main-min.png)

Reports calculate various data and ML **metrics** and render rich **visualizations**. You can create a custom Report or run a preset to evaluate a specific aspect of the model or data performance. For example, a [**Data Quality**](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/presets/data-quality) or [**Classification Performance**](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/presets/class-performance) report.

You can get an **HTML report** (best for exploratory analysis and debugging), **JSON** or Python dictionary output (best for logging, documention or to integrate with BI tools), or as Evidently JSON `snapshot`.

## 3. ML monitoring dashboard

> This functionality is available from v0.4.0. 

![Dashboard example](docs/images/evidently_ml_monitoring_main-min.png)

You can self-host an ML monitoring dashboard to visualize metrics and test results over time. This functionality sits on top of Reports and Test Suites. You must store their outputs as Evidently JSON `snapshots` that serve as a data source for the Evidently Monitoring UI.  

You can track 100+ metrics available in Evidently, from number nulls to text sentiment and embedding drift.

# :woman_technologist: Install Evidently

### MAC OS and Linux
Evidently is available as a PyPI package. To install it using pip package manager, run:
```sh
pip install evidently
```
Evidently is also available on Anaconda distribution platform. To install Evidently using conda installer, run:
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge evidently
```
If you want visualize the Reports or Test Suites inside Jupyter notebook, you need `jupyter nbextension`. After installing `evidently`, run the two following commands in the terminal from the evidently directory. This is not required if you want to use Evidently Monitoring UI.

To install `jupyter nbextension`, run:
```sh
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py evidently
```
To enable it, run:
```sh
jupyter nbextension enable evidently --py --sys-prefix
```
That's it! A single run after the installation is enough. 

### Windows
Evidently is available as a PyPI package. To install it using pip package manager, run:
```sh
pip install evidently
```
To install Evidently using conda installer, run:
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge evidently
```

**Note**: If you run Jupyter notebook on Windows, you will use a different method to display Reports and Test Suites. You must add the argument ```inline``` when calling the Report: ```report.show(mode='inline')```.  Read more about different environments in the [docs](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/integrations/notebook-environments).

# :arrow_forward: Getting started

### Option 1: Test Suites
> This is a simple Hello World example. You can explore a complete tutorial to [Get Started with Reports and Test Suites](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/get-started/tutorial).

Prepare your data as two pandas `DataFrames`. The first is your reference data, and the second is current production data.Â The structure of both datasets should be identical. You need input features only to run some evaluations (e.g., Data Drift). In other cases (e.g., Target Drift, Classification Performance), you need Target and/or Prediction. 

After installing the tool, import the Evidently **Test Suite** and required presets. We'll use a simple toy dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite
from evidently.test_preset import DataStabilityTestPreset
from evidently.test_preset import DataQualityTestPreset

iris_data = datasets.load_iris(as_frame='auto')
iris_frame = iris_data.frame
```

To run the **Data Stability** Test Suite and display the output in the notebook:
```python
data_stability= TestSuite(tests=[
    DataStabilityTestPreset(),
])
data_stability.run(current_data=iris_frame.iloc[:60], reference_data=iris_frame.iloc[60:], column_mapping=None)
data_stability 
```

You can also save an HTML file. You'll need to open it from the destination folder.

```python
data_stability.save_html("file.html")
```

To get the output as JSON:
```python
data_stability.json()
```

### Option 2: Reports

After installing the tool, import the Evidently **Report** and required presets:

```python
import pandas as pd

from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset

iris_data = datasets.load_iris(as_frame='auto')
iris_frame = iris_data.frame
```

To generate the **Data Drift** report, run:
```python
data_drift_report = Report(metrics=[
    DataDriftPreset(),
])

data_drift_report.run(current_data=iris_frame.iloc[:60], reference_data=iris_frame.iloc[60:], column_mapping=None)
data_drift_report

```
Save the report as HTML. You'll later need to open it from the destination folder.
```python
data_drift_report.save_html("file.html")
```

To get the output as JSON:
```python
data_drift_report.json()
```
### Option 3: ML monitoring dashboard
> This will launch a demo project with the Evidently UI service. You can find a complete tutorial to [Get Started with Monitoring](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/get-started/tutorial-monitoring) in the docs.

Recommended step: create a virtual environment and activate it.
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

After installing Evidently (`pip install evidently`), run the Evidently UI with the demo project:
```
evidently ui --demo-project
```
 
Access Evidently UI service in your browser. Go to the **localhost:8000**.
