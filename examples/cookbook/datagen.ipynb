    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored the capabilities of the new `evidently.llm.datagen` API for generating high-quality synthetic datasets for testing and evaluation of LLM systems. Here's a recap of the key concepts and tools demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß™ Dataset Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FewShotDatasetGenerator**: Allows generation based on a few manual examples and a user profile. Ideal for generating social media content, slogans, or short texts.\n",
    "* **RagDatasetGenerator**: Enables generation grounded in a knowledge base, supporting realistic question/answer generation from documents or FAQs.\n",
    "* **RagQueryDatasetGenerator / RagResponseDatasetGenerator**: Allow fine-grained control over multi-stage generation workflows, such as producing diffs and corresponding code reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß© Core Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UserProfile and ServiceSpec**: Provide structured user and service descriptions to simulate realistic scenarios.\n",
    "* **GenerationSpec**: Lets you define the kind of content to generate (e.g., `\"git diff\"`, `\"code review\"`, `\"AI assistant responses\"`).\n",
    "* **PromptBlock**: Enables reusable components to structure prompts, inject motivations, or define response tone and format.\n",
    "* **Templates**: Custom Jinja-style templates can be used to control prompt layout and stylistic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîß Use Cases Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating LLM-ready Twitter datasets with domain knowledge and tone control.\n",
    "* Simulating RAG-style user queries and chatbot responses from a knowledge base.\n",
