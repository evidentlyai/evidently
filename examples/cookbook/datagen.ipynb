    "### ✅ Summary: What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored the capabilities of the new `evidently.llm.datagen` API for generating high-quality synthetic datasets for testing and evaluation of LLM systems. Here's a recap of the key concepts and tools demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧪 Dataset Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FewShotDatasetGenerator**: Allows generation based on a few manual examples and a user profile. Ideal for generating social media content, slogans, or short texts.\n",
    "* **RagDatasetGenerator**: Enables generation grounded in a knowledge base, supporting realistic question/answer generation from documents or FAQs.\n",
    "* **RagQueryDatasetGenerator / RagResponseDatasetGenerator**: Allow fine-grained control over multi-stage generation workflows, such as producing diffs and corresponding code reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Core Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UserProfile and ServiceSpec**: Provide structured user and service descriptions to simulate realistic scenarios.\n",
    "* **GenerationSpec**: Lets you define the kind of content to generate (e.g., `\"git diff\"`, `\"code review\"`, `\"AI assistant responses\"`).\n",
    "* **PromptBlock**: Enables reusable components to structure prompts, inject motivations, or define response tone and format.\n",
    "* **Templates**: Custom Jinja-style templates can be used to control prompt layout and stylistic constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Use Cases Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating LLM-ready Twitter datasets with domain knowledge and tone control.\n",
    "* Simulating RAG-style user queries and chatbot responses from a knowledge base.\n",
    "* Generating synthetic developer workflows like diffs and reviews using real code.\n",
    "* Building end-to-end assistant datasets with templated queries, responses, and structured prompt blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This API gives you composable building blocks for generating test data tailored to your product, domain, and evaluation needs. Whether you’re testing chatbot robustness, fine-tuning with synthetic data, or building eval suites for new LLM apps — `evidently.llm.datagen` provides a flexible, inspectable foundation to start from.\n",
