# Integrations

Evidently can be easily integrated with other tools to fit into the existing workflows. 
Below are a few specific examples of how to integrate Evidently in the prediction pipelines. You can adapt them for other workflow management, visualization, and tracking tools.

To quickly explore what Evidently can do right out of the box, refer to the [sample notebooks](../sample_notebooks/).

To learn how to use specifie Evidently functionality, refer to the [how-to questions](../how_to_questions/).

To better understand potential use cases, refer to the [detailed tutorials](https://docs.evidentlyai.com/examples#tutorials) accompanied by the blog posts.
