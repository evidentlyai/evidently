## :woman_technologist: Installation

### 1. Fork / Clone this repository

Get the tutorial example code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:evidentlyai/evidently.git
cd evidently/examples/integrations/mlflow_integration
```


### 2. Create a virtual environment

- This example requires Python 3.9 or above 

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PWD" >> .venv/bin/activate
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Setup Jupyter Notebooks (optional)

In case you are also interested in Evidently Dashboard visualization in Jupyter install jupyter nbextention:
```bash 
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py evidently
```

And activate it:
```bash 
jupyter nbextension enable evidently --py --sys-prefix
```
More details: https://docs.evidentlyai.com/install-evidently 


### 4 - Download data

This is a preparation step. Load data from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) to the `data/` directory

```bash 
python src/pipelines/load_data.py              
```

## :checkered_flag: View experiments and monitoring reports in MLflow UI
Run MLflow before monitoring examples.
```bash
mlflow ui
``` 
And then navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser
