description: List of all tests available in Evidently.

How to read the tables:

* **Test**: the name of an individual test that you can include in a Test Suite. If a test has an optional parameter, we include an example.  
* **Description**: plain text explanation of the test. We also specify whether the test applies to the whole dataset or individual columns.
* **Default**: description of the default parameters. Many tests have two types of the defaults. The first applies when you pass a reference dataset and Evidently can derive expectations from it. The second applies if you do not provide the reference. You can always override the defaults by specifying a custom condition.   

We organize the tests into logical groups. Note that the groups do not match the presets with the same name, e.g., there are more Data Quality tests below than in the DataQualityTestPreset.

We are doing our best to maintain this page up to date. In case of discrepancies, consult the code on GitHub (API reference coming soon!) or the current version of the "All tests" example notebook in the [Examples](../get-started/examples.md) section. If you notice an error, please send us a pull request to update the documentation!

## Data integrity

If you provide the reference dataset, Evidently will automatically derive all relevant statistics (e.g., share of nulls, etc.) to shape expectations. If you do not provide the reference, you can pass these conditions as a parameter, or run tests with default parameters.

**Note on Null-related tests**. The tests that evaluate the number or share of nulls detect four types of nulls by default: Pandas nulls (None, NAN, etc.), "" (empty string), Numpy "-inf" value, Numpy "inf" value. You can also pass a custom list of nulls as a parameter and specify if you want to replace the default list. Example:

```python
TestNumberOfNulls(null_values=["", 0, "n/a", -9999, None], replace=True)
```

## Data quality

If you provide the reference dataset, Evidently will automatically derive all relevant statistics (e.g., min value, max value, value range, value list, etc.) to shape expectations. If you do not provide the reference, you can pass these conditions as a parameter, or run tests with default parameters.

## Data drift

By default, all data drift tests use the Evidently [drift detection logic](data-drift-algorithm.md) that selects a different statistical test or metric based on feature type and volume. You always need a reference dataset.

To modify the logic or select a different test, you should pass a DataDrift [Options](../customization/options-for-statistical-tests.md) object. 

| Test | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| TestNumberOfDriftedFeatures()<br>options: DataDriftOptions | Dataset-level.  <br><br> Compares the distribution of each column in the current dataset to the reference and computes the number of drifting features. | Expects =< ⅓ features to drift.<br>With reference: If > 1/3 of features drifted, the test fails.<br>No reference: N/A |
| TestShareOfDriftedFeatures()<br>options: DataDriftOptions | Dataset-level.  <br><br> Compares the distribution of each column in the current dataset to the reference and computes the share of drifting features. | Expects =< ⅓ features to drift.<br>With reference: If > 1/3 of features drifted, the test fails.<br>No reference: N/A |
| TestFeatureValueDrift(column_name='name')<br>options: DataDriftOptions<br>    | Column-level. <br><br> Compares the distribution of values in a given column to the reference.  | Expects no drift.<br>With reference: the test fails if the distribution drift is detected in a given column.<br>No reference: N/A |

## Regression

If there is no reference data, Evidently will compare the model performance to a dummy model that predicts the optimal constant (varies by the metric).  

| Test | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| TestValueMAE()<br>    | Dataset-level. <br><br> Computes the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and compares it to the reference if available.  | Expects +/-10% or better than a dummy model.<br><br>**With reference**: if MAE is higher or lower by over 10%, the test fails. <br>**No reference**: the test fails if the MAE value is higher than the MAE of the dummy model that predicts the optimal constant (median of the target value). |

| TestValueAbsMaxError() | Dataset-level. <br><br> Computes the absolute maximum error and compares it to the reference if available | Expects +/-10% or better than a dummy model.<br><br>**With reference**: if the absolute maximum error is higher or lower by over 10%, the test fails. <br>**No reference**: the test fails if the absolute maximum error is higher than the absolute maximum error of the dummy model that predicts the optimal constant (median of the target value). |
| TestValueR2Score() | Dataset-level. <br><br> Computes the R2 Score (coefficient of determination) and compares it to the reference if available. | Expects +/-10% or > 0.<br><br>**With reference**: if R2 is higher or lower by over 10%, the test fails.<br>**No reference**: the test fails if the R2 value is =< 0. |

## Classification

You can apply the tests for non-probabilistic, probabilistic classification, and ranking. Metrics will be calculated slightly differently depending on the provided inputs: only labels, probabilities, decision threshold, and/or K (to compute, e.g., precision@K). 

If there is no reference data, Evidently will compare the model performance to a dummy model. It is based on a set of heuristics to verify that the quality is better than random.
