To access or upload your datasets, navigate to to the [Datasets page](https://app.evidently.cloud/datasets) in the user interface. 

# Upload a CSV file

You can then upload any dataset as a CSV file. When you upload the dataset, you must also add a [column mapping](../input-data/column-mapping.md). This allows Evidently to understand the meaning of specific columns and prepare your dataset for the future evaluations.
