# Pre-built Tabs
{% hint style="success" %}
Dashboard templates is a Pro feature available in the Evidently Cloud and Enterprise. 
{% endhint %}

Template Tabs include a preset combination of monitoring Panels, so you don't have to add them one by one.

To use a template:
* Enter the "Edit" mode by clicking on the top right corner of the Dashboard. 
* Click on the "Add tab" button.
* Choose a template Tab in the dropdown.

Optionally, give a custom name to the Tab.
