# What is a monitoring Panel? 

A monitoring Panel is an individual plot or counter on the Monitoring Dashboard. 

You can add multiple Panels and organize them by **Tabs**. There are several Panel types to choose from, and you can customize titles and legends.

When adding a Panel, you point to the **source Metric or Test** and the value (`field_path`) inside it. Evidently will pull selected value(s) from all snapshots in the Projects and add them to the Panel. 

You can use **Tags** to filter data from specific snapshots. For example, you can plot the accuracy of Model A and Model B next to each other. To achieve this, add relevant tags when creating a snapshot.

Broadly, there are Metric, Distribution, and Test Panels. This page details the panel types.
