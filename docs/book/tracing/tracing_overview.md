description: What is LLM Tracing.
---   

Tracing helps capture a detailed record of how the LLM application works. You can record the system's inputs and outputs, as well as intermediate steps and events, such as calling specific functions.

**Tracely** is an open-source Python library based on OpenTelemetry that helps collect traces of LLM-powered applications.

Once you start collecting the data, you can further analyze and monitor your LLM system: for example, run evaluations on the tracing datasets.
