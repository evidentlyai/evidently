description: How to run regession testing for LLM outputs.
---

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to run regression testing for LLM outputs: for example, compare new and old responses to the same inputs after you change a prompt, model, or anything else in your system. 

When you make changes, you may want to re-run the same inputs and compare the results to find which ones changed significantly. This will allow you to push your updates to production with confidence or find issues to address.

# Tutorial scope

Here's what we'll do:
* **Create a toy dataset**. Create a toy Q&A dataset with answers nd reference responses.
* **Imitate generating new answers**. Imitate generating new answers to the same question we want to compare.
* **Create and run a Test Suite**. We'll compare the answers using the LLM-as-a-judge approach to evaluate length, correctness and style match.
* **Get a monitoring Dashboard**. Build a dashboard to monitor the results of Tests over time.

To complete the tutorial, you will need:
* Basic Python knowledge. 
* An OpenAI API key to use for the LLM evaluator.
* An Evidently Cloud account to track test results. If not yet, [sign up](../installation/cloud_account.md) for a free account.

Use the provided code snippets or run a sample notebook.

```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Need help?** Check how to find API key and [create a Team](../installation/cloud_account.md).
{% endhint %}

# 3. Prepare the Dataset

Create a dataset with questions and reference answers. This data will be used to compare the new responses of your LLM :

```python 
data = [
    ["Why is the sky blue?", "The sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light."],
    ["How do airplanes stay in the air?", "Airplanes stay in the air because their wings create lift by forcing air to move faster over the top of the wing than underneath, which creates lower pressure on top."],
    ["Why do we have seasons?", "We have seasons because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year."],
    ["How do magnets work?", "Magnets work because they have a magnetic field that can attract or repel certain metals, like iron, due to the alignment of their atomic particles."],
    ["Why does the moon change shape?", "The moon changes shape, or goes through phases, because we see different portions of its illuminated half as it orbits the Earth."]
]

columns = ["question", "target_response"]

ref_data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
```

Get a quick preview:

```python 
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
ref_data.head()
```

Here is how the data looks:

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregesting_text_ref.png)

You might want to have a quick look at some data statistics to help you set conditions for Tests. Let's check the text length distribution. This will render a summary Report directly in the notebook cell.

```python 
report = Report(metrics=[
    TextEvals(column_name="target_response", descriptors=[
        TextLength(),
    ]),
])

report.run(reference_data=None,
           current_data=ref_data)

report
```

If you run the example in a non-interactive Python environment, call `report.as_dict()` or `report.json()` instead.

Here is the distribution of text length:

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregtesting_textlength.png)

# 4. Get new answers

Suppose you generate new responses using your LLM after changing a prompt. We will imitate it by adding a new column with new responses to the DataFrame:

```python 
data = [
    ["Why is the sky blue?",
     "The sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.",
     "The sky appears blue because air molecules scatter the sun’s blue light more than they scatter other colors."],

    ["How do airplanes stay in the air?",
     "Airplanes stay in the air because their wings create lift by forcing air to move faster over the top of the wing than underneath, which creates lower pressure on top.",
     "Airplanes stay airborne because the shape of their wings causes air to move faster over the top than the bottom, generating lift."],

    ["Why do we have seasons?",
     "We have seasons because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year.",
     "Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis, leading to varying amounts of sunlight reaching different areas as the Earth orbits the sun."],

    ["How do magnets work?",
     "Magnets work because they have a magnetic field that can attract or repel certain metals, like iron, due to the alignment of their atomic particles.",
     "Magnets generate a magnetic field, which can attract metals like iron by causing the electrons in those metals to align in a particular way, creating an attractive or repulsive force."],

    ["Why does the moon change shape?",
     "The moon changes shape, or goes through phases, because we see different portions of its illuminated half as it orbits the Earth.",
     "The moon appears to change shape as it orbits Earth, which is because we see different parts of its lit-up half at different times. The sun lights up half of the moon, but as the moon moves around the Earth, we see varying portions of that lit-up side. So, the moon's shape in the sky seems to change gradually, from a thin crescent to a full circle and back to a crescent again."]
]

columns = ["question", "target_response", "response"]

eval_data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
```

Here is the resulting dataset with the added new column:

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregesting_text_new.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to run it in production?** In practice, replace this step with calling your LLM app to score the inputs. After you get the new responses, add them to a DataFrame. You can also use our **tracing** library to instrument your app or function and collect traces, that will be automatically converted into a tabular dataset. Evidently will then let you pull a tabular dataset with collected traces. Check the tutorial that shows this [tracing workflow](../examples/tutorial_tracing.md). 
{% endhint %}

# 5. Design the Test suite

Now, you must decide on the evaluation metrics. The goal is to compare if the new answers are different from the old ones. 

You can use some deterministic or embeddings-based metrics like SemanticSimilarity, but often, you'd want to make the comparison using more specific criteria you control. In this case, using LLM-as-a-judge is a valuable approach that allows you to formulate custom criteria on what you want to detect.

Let's say we want to Test that:
* All responses must be within the expected length. Looking at our previous responses, we've set it as between 80 and 200 symbols.
* All new responses must give essentially the same answer without contradiction. We will call this criterion CORRECTNESS and implement it using LLM-as-a-judge.
* That all new responses are the same in style compared to the reference. We will call this criterion STYLE and implement it using LLM-as-a-judge.
  
Evidently has a few built-in LLM-based evaluators, but this time we'll write our custom LLM judges.

## Correctness judge 

Here is how we implement the correctness evaluator, using a built-in Evidenty template for binary classification. We are asking LLM to classify every response as correct or not based on what is in the `{target_response}` column and give a reasoning for that decision.

```python
correctness_eval= LLMEval(
    subcolumn="category",
    additional_columns={"target_response": "target_response"},
    template = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(
        criteria = """
An ANSWER is correct when it is the same as the REFERENCE in all facts and details, even if worded differently.
The ANSWER is incorrect if it contradicts the REFERENCE, adds additional claims, omits or changes details.

REFERENCE:

=====
{target_response}
=====
        """,
        target_category="incorrect",
        non_target_category="correct",
        uncertainty="unknown",
        include_reasoning=True,
        pre_messages=[("system", "You are an expert evaluator. will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE.")],
        ),
    provider = "openai",
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    display_name = "Correctness",
)
```

We strongly recommend splitting evaluation criteria into individual judges and using more straightforward grading scale like binary classifiers for reliability.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Don't forget to evaluate your judge!** Each LLM evaluator is a small ML system you should tune to align with your preferences. We recommend running a couple of iterations to tune it. Check the tutorial on [creating LLM judges](cookbook_llm_judge.md). 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Docs on LLM judge**. For an explanation of each parameter, check the docs on [LLM judge functionality](../customization/llm_as_a_judge.md). 
{% endhint %}

## Style judge

Using a similar approach, we will create a judge for style. We add additonal clarifications to specify what we mean by style match. 

```python
style_eval= LLMEval(
    subcolumn="category",
    additional_columns={"target_response": "target_response"},
    template = BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate(
        criteria = """
An ANSWER is style-matching when it matches the REFERENCE answer in style.
The ANSWER is style-mismatched when it diverges from the REFERENCE answer in style.

Consider the following STYLE attributes:
- tone (friendly, formal, casual, sarcastic, etc.)
- sentence structure (simple, compound, complex, etc.)
- verbosity level (relative length of answers)
- and other similar attributes that may reflect difference in STYLE.

You must focus only on STYLE. Ignore any differences in contents.

=====
{target_response}
=====
        """,
        target_category="style-matching",
        non_target_category="style-mismatched",
        uncertainty="unknown",
        include_reasoning=True,
        pre_messages=[("system", "You are an expert evaluator. will be given an ANSWER and REFERENCE.")],
        ),
    provider = "openai",
    model = "gpt-4o-mini",
    display_name = "Style",
)
```

## Complete Test Suite

Now, we can create a Test Suite that incorporates the correctness evaluation, style matching, and text length checks. 
* To formulate what we Test, we pick an appropriate Evidently column-level Test like `TestCategoryCount` and `TestShareOfOutRangeValues`. (You can pick other Tests, like `TestColumnValueMin` , `TestColumnValueMean`, etc.)
* Set additional parameters for each Test, if applicable. For example, we use `left` and `right` parameters to set the allowed range for Text Length. 
* To set the Test condition, we use parameters like `gt` (greater than), `lt` (less than), `eq` (equal), etc.
* You can also identify some non-critical Tests, as we do with the Style match check. If such Test fails, it will give a Warning, but not an Error. This helps divide it visually on monitoring Panels and to set up alerting only for Fails. 

Here is how we formulate the complete Test Suite. We reference two of our judges, `style_eval` and `correctness_eval,` and point out that they should apply to the `response` column in our dataset. For Text Length, we use a built-in `TextLength()` descriptor.

```python
test_suite = TestSuite(tests=[
    TestCategoryCount(
        column_name=style_eval.on("response"),
        category="style-mismatched",
        eq=0,
        is_critical=False),
    TestCategoryCount(
        column_name=correctness_eval.on("response"),
        category="incorrect",
        eq=0),
    TestShareOfOutRangeValues(
        column_name=TextLength(display_name="Response Length")
            .on("response"),
        left=80,
        right=200,
        eq=0),
])
```

Note that in this example, we always expect the share of failures to be zero using the `eq=0` condition. For example, you can swap the Test condition for text length for `lte=0.1`, which would stand for "less than 10%". In this case, the Test will fail if > 10% of rows in the dataset are longer than the set range.

Allowing some share of Tests to fail is convenient for real-world applications.

You can add additional Tests as you see fit for regular expressions, word presence, etc. and Tests for other columns in the same Test Suite.

{% hint style="info" %} 
**Understand Tests**. Learn how to set [custom Test conditions](../tests-and-reports/run-tests.md) and use [Tests with text Descriptors](../tests-and-reports/text-descriptors.md). See the list of [All tests](../reference/all-tests.md). 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %} 
**Understand Descriptors**. See the list of available text Descriptors in the [All metrics](../reference/all-metrics.md) table. 
{% endhint %}

# 6. Run the Test Suite

Now that our Test Suite is ready - let's run it!

To apply this Test Suite to the `eval_data`, we prepared earlier:

```python
test_suite.run(reference_data=None, current_data=eval_data)
```

This will compute the Test Suite! But how do you see it? You can actually preview the results directly in your Python notebook (call `test_suite`), but we'll now send it to Evidently Cloud, together with the scored data:

```python
ws.add_test_suite(project.id, test_suite, include_data=True)
```

Including data is optional but useful for most LLM use cases since you'd want to see not just the aggregate Test results but also the raw texts to debug when Tests fail.

Now, navigate to the Evidently Platform UI. Go to the ([Home Page](https://app.evidently.cloud/)), enter your Project, and find the "Test Suites" section in the left menu. As you enter it, you will see the resulting Test Suite that you can Explore. Once you open this view, you will see both the summary Test results and the Dataset with the added scores and explanations.

You can browse your Dataset view by selecting individual Columns to zoom in on the results of specific evaluations. For example, you might want to sort all columns by Text Length to find the one that is out of bounds or to find the style-mismatched answers as labeled by the LLM judge.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregtesting_test_1.png)

**Note**: your explanations will vary since LLMs are non-deterministic.

{% hint style="info" %} 
**Using Tags**. You can optionally attach Tags to your Test Suite to associate this specific run with some parameter, like a prompt version. Check the [docs on generating snapshots](../evaluations/snapshots.md).
{% endhint %}


# 7. Test again

Let's say you made yet another change to the prompt. Our reference dataset stays the same, but we generate a new set of answers that we want to compare to this reference. 

Here is the toy `eval_data_2` to imitate the result of the change.

```python
data = [
    ["Why is the sky blue?",
     "The sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.",
     "The sky looks blue because air molecules scatter the blue light from the sun more effectively than other colors."],

    ["How do airplanes stay in the air?",
     "Airplanes stay in the air because their wings create lift by forcing air to move faster over the top of the wing than underneath, which creates lower pressure on top.",
     "Airplanes fly by generating lift through the wings, which makes the air move faster above them, lowering the pressure."],

    ["Why do we have seasons?",
     "We have seasons because the Earth is tilted on its axis, which causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year.",
     "Seasons change because the distance between the Earth and the sun varies throughout the year."],  # This response contradicts the reference.

    ["How do magnets work?",
     "Magnets work because they have a magnetic field that can attract or repel certain metals, like iron, due to the alignment of their atomic particles.",
     "Magnets operate by creating a magnetic field, which interacts with certain metals like iron due to the specific alignment of atomic particles."],

    ["Why does the moon change shape?",
     "The moon changes shape, or goes through phases, because we see different portions of its illuminated half as it orbits the Earth.",
     "The moon's phases occur because we observe varying portions of its lit half as it moves around the Earth."]
]

columns = ["question", "target_response", "response"]

eval_data_2 = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
```

Now, we can apply the same Test Suite to this data and send it to Evidently Cloud.

```python
test_suite.run(reference_data=None, current_data=eval_data_2)
ws.add_test_suite(project.id, test_suite, include_data=True)
```

If you go and open the new Test Suite results, you can again explore the outcomes and explanations.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregtesting_test_2.png)

# 8. Get a Dashboard

You can continue running Test Suites in this manner. As you run multiple Test Suites, you may want to track their results over time clearly. 

You can easily create a Dashboard to track Test outcomes over time. You can edit the monitoring Panels in the UI or programmatically. Let's create a couple of Panels using Dashboards as a code approach.

The following code will add:
* A counter panel to show the SUCCESS rate of the latest test run.
* A test monitoring panel to show all test results over time.

```python
project.dashboard.add_panel(
     DashboardPanelTestSuiteCounter(
        title="Latest Test run",
        filter=ReportFilter(metadata_values={}, tag_values=[], include_test_suites=True),
        size=WidgetSize.FULL,
        statuses=[TestStatus.SUCCESS],
        agg=CounterAgg.LAST,
    ),
    tab="Tests"
)
project.dashboard.add_panel(
    DashboardPanelTestSuite(
        title="Test results",
        filter=ReportFilter(metadata_values={}, tag_values=[], include_test_suites=True),
        size=WidgetSize.FULL,
        panel_type=TestSuitePanelType.DETAILED,
        time_agg="1min",
    ),
    tab="Tests"
)
project.save()
```

When you navigate to the UI, you will now see the Dashboard, which shows a summary of Test results (Success, Failure, and Warning) for each Test Suite we ran. As you add more Tests to the same Project, the Panels will be automatically updated to show new Test results.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cookbook/llmregesting_test_dashboard.png)

If you hover over individual Test results, you will able to see the specific Test and conditions.

{% hint style="info" %} 
**Using Dashboards**. You can design and add other Panel types. Check the [docs on Dashboards](../dashboard/dashboard_overview.md).
{% endhint %}

**What's next?** As you design a similar Test Suite for your use case, you can integrate it with CI/CD workflows to run on every change.
