

To add a custom metric or test, you need to directly implement the calculation method and (optional) visualization. 

You can take the metrics and tests that exist in the codebase as an example. 

**Note**: this is advanced functionality that expects you to be able to work with the codebase independently. To implement the visualization, you should be familiar with Plotly. 

This example notebook shows how to add a simple metric and test and include them in Reports or Test Suites:

We plan to simplify this functionality in the future. 

If you want to suggest adding specific metrics or tests that are currently not covered, you can also [open an issue](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently/issues) with the feature request on GitHub.
