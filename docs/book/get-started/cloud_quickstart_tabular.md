description: ML Monitoring “Hello world.” From data to dashboard in a couple of minutes.

# 1. Set up Evidently Cloud 

Set up your Evidently Cloud workspace:
* **Sign up**. If you do not have one yet, sign up for a free [Evidently Cloud account](https://app.evidently.cloud/signup).
* **Create an Organization**. When you log in the first time, create and name your Organization.
* **Create a Team**. Click **Teams** in the left menu. Create a Team, copy and save the Team ID. ([Team page](https://app.evidently.cloud/teams)).
* **Get your API token**. Click the **Key** icon in the left menu. Generate and save the token. ([Token page](https://app.evidently.cloud/token)).

You can now go to your Python environment.

# 2. Install the Python library

Install the Evidently Python library. You can run this example in Colab or another Python environment.

```
!pip install evidently
```

Import the components to work with the dataset and send the metrics. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets

from evidently.ui.workspace.cloud import CloudWorkspace
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataQualityPreset
```

# 3. Create a new Project 

Connect to Evidently Cloud using your access token.

```python
ws = CloudWorkspace(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", url="https://app.evidently.cloud")
```

Create a new Project inside your Team. Pass the `team_id`.

```python
project = ws.create_project("My test project", team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID")
project.description = "My project description"
project.save()
```

# 4. Import a toy dataset 

Import the demo "adult" dataset as a pandas DataFrame. 

```python
adult_data = datasets.fetch_openml(name="adult", version=2, as_frame="auto")
adult = adult_data.frame
```

# 5. Run an evaluation 

Run a Data Quality Report and upload it to the Project.

```
data_report = Report(
       metrics=[
           DataQualityPreset(),
       ],
    )
data_report.run(reference_data=None, current_data=adult)
ws.add_report(project.id, data_report)
```

We call each such evaluation result a `snapshot`.

# 6. View the Report

Visit Evidently Cloud, open your Project, and navigate to the "Report" tab to see the data stats.

# 7. Add a monitoring panel

Go to the "Dashboard" tab and enter the "Edit" mode. Add a new tab, and select the "Data quality" template.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cloud/qs_add_data_quality_tab_2.gif)

You'll see a set of panels with a single data point. As you send more snapshots, you can track trends and set up alerts. You can choose from 100+ metrics and tests on data quality, data drift, ML quality (regression, classification, ranking, recsys), LLM quality and text data, and add your own metrics.
