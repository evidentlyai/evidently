description: LLM evaluation “Hello world.” Open-source and cloud workflow.

# 1. Installation

Install the Evidently Python library. You can run this example in Colab or any Python environment.

```
!pip install evidently
```

Import the necessary components:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import datasets
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import TextEvals

import nltk
nltk.download('words')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

**Optional**. Import components to send evaluation results to Evidently Cloud:

```python
from evidently.ui.workspace.cloud import CloudWorkspace
```

# 2. Import the toy dataset 

Import a toy dataset with e-commerce reviews. 

```python
reviews_data = datasets.fetch_openml(name='Womens-E-Commerce-Clothing-Reviews', version=2, as_frame='auto')
reviews = reviews_data.frame[:100]
```
# 3. Run the evals

Run a basic evaluation Preset to check text sentiment (on a scale of -1 to 1), text length, etc., for the "Reviews" column.

```python
text_evals_report = Report(metrics=[
    TextEvals(column_name="Review_Text")
    ]
)

text_evals_report.run(reference_data=None, current_data=reviews)
```

There are more evals to choose from. You can also create custom ones, including LLM-as-a-judge.

View a Report in Python:

```
text_evals_report
```

You can export results as HTML, JSON, or a Python dictionary to use elsewhere, or send to Evidently Cloud for monitoring.

# 4. Send results to Evidently Cloud 

To record and track evaluation results over time, send them to Evidently Cloud. You need an API key.
* Sign up for [an Evidently Cloud account](https://app.evidently.cloud/signup).
* After login, click "plus" to add a new Team. For example, "Personal". Copy the team ID from [Team's page](https://app.evidently.cloud/teams).
* Click the key icon in the left menu, select "personal token," generate and save the token.

Connect to Evidently Cloud using your token and create a Project inside your Team:

```python
ws = CloudWorkspace(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", url="https://app.evidently.cloud")

project = ws.create_project("My test project", team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID")
project.description = "My project description"
project.save()
```

Visit Evidently Cloud, open your Project, and navigate to the "Report" to see evaluation results.

In the future, you can log ongoing evaluation results to build monitoring panels and send alerts.
