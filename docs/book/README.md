# What is Evidently?

## What is it?

Evidently helps **evaluate** and **monitor** machine learning models in production. It generates interactive reports or JSON profiles from pandas `DataFrames`or `csv` files.&#x20;

You can use **visual reports** for ad hoc analysis, debugging and team sharing, and **JSON profiles** to integrate Evidently in prediction pipelines or with other visualization tools.

Evidently currently works with **tabular data**. 6 reports are available.

### [1. Data Drift](reports/data-drift.md)

Detects changes in feature distribution.

### [2. Numerical Target Drift](reports/num-target-drift.md)

Detects changes in numerical target and feature behavior.

### [3. Categorical Target Drift](reports/categorical-target-drift.md)

Detects changes in categorical target and feature behavior.

### [4. Regression Model Performance](reports/reg-performance.md)

Analyzes the performance of a regression model and model errors.

### [5. Classification Model Performance](reports/classification-performance.md)

Analyzes the performance and errors of a classification model. Works both for binary and multi-class models.

### [6. Probabilistic Classification Model Performance](reports/probabilistic-classification-performance.md)

Analyzes the performance of a probabilistic classification model, quality of the model calibration, and model errors. Works both for binary and multi-class models.
