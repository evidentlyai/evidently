# Reports

Evidently includes a set of pre-built Reports. Each of them addresses a specific aspect of the data or model performance. You can think of reports as combinations of the metrics and statistical tests that are grouped together.  

The calculation results can be available in one of the following formats:

* An interactive visual **Dashboard** displayed inside the Jupyter notebook.
* An **HTML report.** Same as dashboard, but available as a standalone file.
* A **JSON profile.** A summary of the metrics, the results of statistical tests, and simple histograms.

## Reports by type

Evidently currently works with **tabular data**. 7 reports are available. You can combine, customize the reports or contribute your own report.
