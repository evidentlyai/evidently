# Evidently Cloud Account 

## 1. Create an Account

If not already, [sign up for an Evidently Cloud account](https://app.evidently.cloud/signup). 

## 2. Create an Organization

Once you log in to Evidently Cloud for the first time, create an Organization and give it a name. 

## 3. Create a Team 

Click on the **Teams** icon on the left menu. Create a Team and give it a name, such as "Personal." 

Teams help organize your work on different use cases. Every Project that you create exists within a given Team. 

You can create multiple Teams inside the Organization and add other users to the Teams.

Now, you are all set to start using Evidently Cloud! 

# Access Token

You will need an access token to interact with Evidently Cloud from your Python environment.

Click the **Key** icon in the left menu to go. Generate and save the token securely. ([Token page](https://app.evidently.cloud/token)).

This is optional; you can also work from the user interface.

Now, you can create your first Project and start sending the data and running evaluations!
