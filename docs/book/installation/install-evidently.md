# Installing from PyPI

## MAC OS and Linux

Evidently is available as a PyPI package.

To install it using the pip package manager, run:

```bash
$ pip install evidently
```

To display dashboards **in a Jupyter notebook**, Evidently uses jupyter nbextension. If you want to explore reports inside a Jupyter notebook, then after installing `evidently` you should run the **two following commands** in the terminal from the Evidently directory. 

To install jupyter nbextension, run:

```
$ jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink --overwrite --py evidently
```

To enable it, run:

```
$ jupyter nbextension enable evidently --py --sys-prefix
```

That's it! A single run after the installation is enough.

**Note**: if you **do not install nbextension**, you can still use Evidently. You can get the outputs as JSON, Python dictionary, or generate standalone HTML files to view in the browser.
{% endhint %}

**Note**: if you **use other notebook environments, e.g. Jupyter Lab**, Evidently might work differently. See more details below. 
{% endhint %}

## Google Colab

You can run `evidently` in Google Colab. 

To install `evidently`, run the following command in the notebook cell:

```
!pip install evidently
```
There is no need to enable nbextension for this case. `Evidently` uses an alternative way to display visuals.

## Other hosted notebooks

You can run `evidently` in Kaggle Notebook, Jupyter Lab, Deepnote, Databricks or other notebook environments. Note that **only Google Colab** is currently officially supported.

To install `evidently`, run the following command in the notebook cell:

```
!pip install evidently
```

**Note**: There is no need to enable nbextension for this case. `Evidently` uses an alternative way to display visuals in the hosted notebooks. Note that you will need to **explicitly specify the inline method** in your code when calling the Report or Test Suite. Consult [this section](../integrations/notebook-environments.md) for help. If you face issues, you can get the output as a separate HTML file and view it in a browser.

## Windows

Evidently is available as a PyPI package.

To install it using the pip package manager, run:

```bash
$ pip install evidently
```

**Note**: Nbextension does not work on Windows. If you want to generate visual reports in Jupyter notebook on Windows, you need to use a different visualization method. Note that you will need to **explicitly specify the inline method** in your code when calling the Report or Test Suite. Consult [this section](../integrations/notebook-environments.md) for help. This is a new functionality with limited testing. If you face issues, you can get the output as a separate HTML file and view it in a browser.
